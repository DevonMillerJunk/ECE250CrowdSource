Useful tips:
An easy way to be able to test/edit code on your computer and then transfer to the eceubuntu server is to use SFTP and SSH.
SFTP is Secure File Transfer Protocol that allows you to send and receive files from the server. Look up swish sftp for download.
SSH is secure shell and allows you to access the command line for the server.
Simply transfer your files with SFTP to the server, then compile and run them on the server to create an easy way to test in their environment.
