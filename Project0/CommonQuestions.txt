1. How to deal with Std IN / Std OUT
2. For the coeff_p1 method, are the inputs ordered? Can there be repeats? Will they always follow with a ';' and the degree?
    - The inputs are garunteed to be in order, with no skips, no repeates, and no errors, as follows: 
    "COMMAND EXP COEFF;EXP COEFF;EXP COEFF ..." The line does not end with a ";".
3. Is there a limit to how many polynomials we can receive with the input?
4. Can a polynomial of degree n have a coefficient of 0 for x^n?  If yes, shoud, for example, 1 + x and 1 + x + 0x^2 be considered equal when compared?

REMINDER: MAKE A FLOAT COMPARISON FUNCTION!!!! FLoats will not turn out exactly alike so make a comparison one just in case.
